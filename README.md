I have created a shiny application using COVID-19 Cases in Toronto. The dataset is avaiable on the OpenDataToronto.


Viewers are able to interact with the line chart by sliding the bar panel left and right. Through this interactive line chart, people can know more clearly about the new COIVD-19 cases every month.
